# Get Food - Swiggy Clone

## Project Overview

Get Food is a Swiggy clone, developed using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and other modern web technologies. The project aims to replicate the essential features of the popular food delivery platform Swiggy, providing users with a seamless and responsive experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** The project is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable components, making the application modular and efficient.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to styling components. It helps in creating a clean and responsive design for the application.

- **Swiggy Live API Data:** The application utilizes Swiggy live API data to fetch information about restaurants, menus, and other related details. The implementation is config-driven, allowing for flexibility and easy adaptation to changes in the API.

- **React Router DOM:** For managing navigation and creating a smooth, single-page application experience, React Router DOM is employed. It enables the definition of routes and navigation between different views within the application.

- **react-hot-toast:** Toast messages play a crucial role in providing feedback to users. The project integrates `react-hot-toast` for displaying notification messages, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

- **Redux Toolkit:** For state management, the application uses Redux Toolkit. Redux allows for a centralized store, making it easier to manage and share the application's state across various components.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Config-Driven API:** The implementation of a config-driven API ensures flexibility in adapting to changes in the Swiggy live API. This allows for seamless updates and modifications without extensive code changes.

- **Toast Messages:** User interactions and feedback are enhanced with the use of toast messages powered by `react-hot-toast`.

- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit is employed for efficient state management, providing a centralized store for the application's state.
